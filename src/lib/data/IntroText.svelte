<p>
    I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Heriot-Watt University</a>, Scotland.
    I work at the crossroad between <b>Data Science</b>, <b>Machine Learning</b>, and <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b>.
</p>
<p>
    I specialise in <b>Information Visualisation</b> research, with a strong background in Programming
    and Software Engineering. I aim to explore the complex interactions between data, models, and the
    humnan mind. My weapons of choice are JavaScript, D3, Python, and Java.
</p>
<p>
    Outside of computers and programming, I like to solve puzzles, play games, read and cook.
